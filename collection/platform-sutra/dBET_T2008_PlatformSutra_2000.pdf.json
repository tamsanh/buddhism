  "blurb": "There are eternal truths in the Platform Sutra. The primacy of the buddha-nature, the identity of meditation and wisdom, the \“formless\” approach to repentance and the precepts, the samādhi of the single practice—all these are religious principles that are valid beyond the limits of this one brilliant scripture. The most resounding truth, of course, is the doctrine that status, education, cultural or racial origin, and even spiritual training have nothing to do with the realization of perfect enlightenment. The only criterion of any significance whatsoever is the experience of \“seeing the buddha-nature,\” realizing one’s innate status as an enlightened being. This truth is embodied in the person of Huineng.",
